# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my custom Neovim configuration, built upon the foundation of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Overview

I adapted this configuration by making adjustments to key mappings, dependencies, and various Neovim's settings.

## Installation

To use this configuration:

1. **Clone Repository**: Navigate to your Neovim configuration directory:

    ```shell
    cd ~/.config
    ```

    Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/StPfeffer/nvim.git
    ```

2. **Load Configuration**: The next time you launch Neovim, it will automatically load this configuration, seamlessly integrating it into your environment.

That's it! Enjoy the enhanced Neovim experience.
